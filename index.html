          The UNHCR is in charge of resettlement with the help of participating
          countries, such as the US, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom,
          Australia and the Nordic countires. Among these countries, the US has
          been the world's top resettlement country.
        </p>
        <p>
          While European countries, the US and Canada have traditionally taken
          on an important role in global refugee resettlement, countries and
          regions in Asia and Africa have seen a growing number of refugees
          seeking asylum since 1980s.
